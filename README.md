# Machine-Learning-for-IoT
IoT devices are becoming popular nowadays. The widespread use of IoT yields huge amounts of raw data. This data can be effectively processed by using machine learning to derive many useful insights that can become game changers and affect our lives deeply.
ML is becoming an essential player in a growing array of process areas involving image recognition, natural language processing, forecasting, prediction, and process optimization. ML is evolving to the point of being able to draw interesting patterns and inferences from these real time data streams, and make those results available to analysts as well as to embed them directly in business processes.

## Problem Statement
In this problem, we have to forecast the traffic in 4 junctions for 4 months. We have hour level data of junctions `1`,`2`, and `3` from `2015-11-01 00:00:00` to `2017-06-30 23:00:00` and hour level data of junction `4` from `2017-01-01 00:00:00` to `2017-06-30 23:00:00`.
